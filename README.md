https://ashesofcreation.com/

Valor was brought in to redesign, and replatform their web experience as well as their eCommerce platform.

This was a unique challenge as any time that finances are involved testing becomes more serious. In addition to the regular automation and manual testing, the patterns of usage for their site required heavy emphasis on load testing because they receive bursts of traffic during live streams. As work was completed and tested it would frequently go through another quality pass by the customer where they would do one final check before release, this was often the day before a live stream.
